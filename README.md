What is Binary Tree Data Structure? A binary tree is a tree-type non-linear data structure with a maximum of two children for each parent. Every node in a binary tree has a left and right reference along with the data element. The node at the top of the hierarchy of a tree is called the root node

A parent node has two child nodes: the left child and right child. Hashing, routing data for network traffic, data compression, preparing binary heaps, and binary search trees are some of the applications that use a binary tree.

## Terminologies associated with Binary Trees and Types of Binary Trees
* Node: It represents a termination point in a tree.
* Root: A tree’s topmost node. 
* Parent: Each node (apart from the root) in a tree that has at least one sub-node of its own is called a parent node.
* Child: A node that straightway came from a parent node when moving away from the root is the child node.
* Leaf Node: These are external nodes. They are the nodes that have no child.
* Internal Node: As the name suggests, these are inner nodes with at least one child.
* Depth of a Tree: The number of edges from the tree’s node to the root is.
* Height of a Tree: It is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf. The tree height is also considered the root height.
